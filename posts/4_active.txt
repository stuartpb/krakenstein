[QUOTE=ytv1;13805105]Good weapon look and the pics are also funny. However, I fear this Medigun promotes more staying behind and camping. As stated in the developer's commentary, they did not want the Medic to be like he was in TFC where he always had to stay behind and was never truly involved in the action. He was just an anchor for the team to fall back to and get healed.

It would be much more interesting if the Medic joined in the action on the front lines. And for that reason, I do not support this idea; there are many other alternatives to implementing the Overhealer idea that don't reduce the amount of skill required to play Medic.[/QUOTE]

Assuming you're referring to commentary node 16/16 near Point A on Gravel Pit (tf2-Comment024):
[QUOTE][John Morello] [I]The Medic is the main support class. Previous support classes we've designed had a variety of problems. They didn't require much skill, because they stayed back in defended areas, which also kept them out of the funnest parts of the game. Worst of all, this meant they weren't even terribly useful because they generally weren't near the players who most needed to be healed. We designed the Team Fortress 2 Medic to solve these problems, primarily by focusing on keeping them right in the thick of battle. Additionally, we designed the medigun to be as easy to use as possible, so that Medics can focus on survival while healing teammates. Virtually no aiming is required, which lets Medics concentrate on following their heal target, who has a huge incentive to keep his Medic benefactor safe.[/I][/QUOTE]

For one, as an unlockable choice, the playstyle offered by the Krakenstein isn't as problematic as it was during initial development, where, as the sole option available to all players, each weapon had to provide an active, one-size-fits-all gameplay experience. Unlocks permit more specialized approaches, such as the Scottish Resistance and the Direct Hit, which provide a better experience for trapping and targeting, but are much less flexible for attacking and sieging, respectively. For healing players in the thick of battle, Medics still have the option to use the standard Medigun, which was designed around that specific goal.

The issue of this item impeding Medics from participating in front-line action, however, does come into sharper focus now. It might be better, then, to have the medic only slow down to Demoman speed (280) while activating the Krakenstein, and have each additional heal target simply reduce his speed by 25 (with a minimum speed of 80). This would make the Krakenstein more viable for closer-combat use (reducing a Medic to a running Heavy's speed while healing 2 targets), while still preventing the mobile healing of a major flotilla.

I've edited the original post to link to this one at the relevant points. (For the record, the original proposal was to just have a flat reduction to 80 HUPS while using the Krakenstein.)
