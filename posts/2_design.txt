One fun thing about this design is that the model has all sorts of meanings, influences and interpretations. Here are the ones I had in mind while making it:

There's the obvious keg/cask and beer stein thing, that ties into the Medic's German heritage and "Oktoberfest!" proclivities.

There's also the Frankenstein image, specifically integrated with the bolts on the side at approximately where the "neck" is (and further hinted at with the stitch-like floral design on the BLU color example). This is another German thing, this time oriented toward the Medic's "Mad Doctor" tendencies (and his fascination with life and death). With The Krakenstein on the Medic's back, it has a sort of [url=http://artfiles.art.com/images/-/Luke-Skywalker-Yoda-oversized-postcard-Poster-Card-C10229167.jpeg]Luke and Yoda[/url] (or, more accurately, [url=http://web.mit.edu/mtg/www/2005/FAL/photos/tech/IMG_9073.JPG]Chewie and Threepio[/url]) appearance.

There's also the namesake [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraken]Kraken[/url] aspect of the item, which is a mythological squid-like sea monster that provides the word for "octopus" in German (If you're playing on a Highlander server, 8 would be the most Krakenstein beams to grab your team. Also, [b]Okto[/b]berfest). The multiple beams that emerge [url=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nautilus]Nautilus[/url]-like from the Krakenstein are of course very "grabby", with lots of tentacle-esque twisting (as 8 plain straight lines are rather dull).
