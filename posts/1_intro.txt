Don't you hate it when you hang on the battlefield behind cover with half of your team, slowly refilling their health one by one so they can each [url=http://forums.steampowered.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1142125]run out and die[/url] in turn? The very latest in demented German mad science may hold the cure!

The Krakenstein is a barrel-like cannon that replaces the Medigun. It's strapped to the Medic's back in place of the normal pack when not in use, and is toted under the arm when deployed.

A healing beam from The Krakenstein remains attached as long as you [b]look straight at your target[/b]. "Poppywallop!", you say. "How will I be able to ogle the calendar textures if I have to stare at my damaged and ugly teammates while I heal them?" But wait! After you look away from your target, [b]the beam remains on them[/b] for [post=13934974]up to two seconds[/post]. Better yet, this beam [b]does not go away when you begin healing someone else[/b], allowing you to [b]simultaneously heal as many teammates as you can keep within your sight[/b].

Due to the added weight of The Krakenstein on his back, a Medic wearing The Krakenstein loses his speed advantage over most classes, and walks at [post=13807619]a reduced speed[/post] while he holds it down. The Krakenstein also outputs less individual healing than the ordinary Medigun, so consider putting it away when you find yourself abandoned in the field.

[SIZE="5"][b]TL;DR: NITTY GRITTY BY THE NUMBERS[/b][/SIZE][/CENTER]
Here are the exact properties I've come up with without any actual field prototyping. I don't know if the duration between looking at players needs to be longer, the speed hits are too insignificant, the healing is too far gimped, or just the reverse for all of the above.

One of the main goals of this medigun is to encourage falling back to heal. With the Medic rooted by the active slowdown of the Krakenstein, players must remain with the Medic while being healed. To accommodate this, while the base healing rate is lower, it begins the [url=http://www.teamfortress.com/post.php?id=1656]ramp up[/url] to its maximum heal rate much sooner.

Of course, even with the higher multiplier the Krakenstein plateaus at a much lower rate than the Medigun, so players will overall spend more time near their Medic. This incites teamwork, as, like [url=http://www.teamfortress.com/soldierupdate/index.htm#item_3]The Buff Banner[/url], this encourages players to rally around the mutual defense of a single player, and as all of the players are healed at once, players coming in from the same Heavy attack or splash damage will all be ready to return to combat at roughly the same time (similar to [url=http://www.tf2.com/post.php?id=1872]the respawn "wave" mechanic[/url]).

The blue bar highlights the Medic's normal speed. The yellow bar immediately next to it would be the speed with the Krakenstein, and the yellow bar to the far right would be the [post=13807619](minimum)[/post] speed when healing. The marginal loss of speed to the Medic allows him to get close to the front lines in nearly the same time (and to retreat effectively when anticipating an ambush), but disallows the freedom of movement to track with an ally into battle (which is doubly ineffective with the Krakenstein's slow active movement speed and low healing rate anyway).

[CENTER][SIZE="5"][b]WHAT ABOUT THE ÜBERCHARGE?[/b][/SIZE]

[img]http://img3.imageshack.us/img3/9145/krakensteinuber.jpg[/img]
[SIZE="2"][I](Figure 1.)[/I][/SIZE][/CENTER]

Accumulation is simple enough. I was thinking of giving it 1/4 of the normal Medigun's accumulation rate per player (1/2 for the halved base heal rate and 1/2 for the multiple player healing- only half because, although more than 2 can be healed at once, it's not as easy to glom onto someone and build up charge, and so any more than 2 should raise the uber accumulation).

The actual Übercharge idea I have for The Krakenstein, however, is the most "out there" aspect of its design. The idea (depicted in Figure 1) is to cut all of the peripheral beams and, for 8 seconds, have only one non-attaching beam blasting straight out with infinite range that heals at 96 HP/s with [url=http://tf2wiki.net/wiki/Overhealer]the aborted Overhealer's 200% non-dissipating overheal[/url] (as well as blasting the Medic's regeneration to 96 HP/s with generation going up to 225 HP- this overheal would dissipate).

This would set up a fantastic push, or it could be used as a kind of invulnerability substitute, with headshots, backstabs, and stickybomb cluster detonation kills still possible and enemy Soldiers and Medics still capable of accumulating Rage and Ubersaw charge, respectively.

To make the Übercharge valid for active combat, since headshots and backstabs would be extremely easy to perform on a rooted and vulnerable medic (although the extent to which the Medic would be "rooted" while deploying this is [post=13807619]unspecified[/post]), aiming this beam at an enemy (including a disguised spy) would spin them away (see Figure 2).
